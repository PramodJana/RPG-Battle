# RPG-Battle
A python implementation of a text based/terminal battle game 

Ended up having to rewrite a good portion of it, so I've improved quite a bit of it. 
Now with awesome HP/MP bars, multiple enemies and party members, and items

I hade made corrections in nickgermaine RPG-Battle game now it works well...
